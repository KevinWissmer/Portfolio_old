            The best way to improve logical thinking, in my opinion is, to solve logical
            riddles. Those riddles can be hidden everywhere, not only at developing and programming complex code.

            Mechanical systems are one of my favorite logical riddles, therefore i restored a
            very old motorcycle (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simson_S_51" target="_blank">Simson S51</a>) all
            by
            myself.

            I am also collecting puzzleobjects and books about those riddles and, that is what a
            scientist would say, problems!

            And of course i am searching for complex system building in games, but not only
            playing games is the fun for me. I enjoy to improve some little things. I've written some tiny bots and
            packages for games (mostly Minecraft with Java). Next step will be maybe a little game by myself!
